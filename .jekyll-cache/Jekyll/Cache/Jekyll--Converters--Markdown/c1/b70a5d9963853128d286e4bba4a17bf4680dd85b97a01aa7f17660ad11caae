I"Ë<p>Recently, Prof. Zhichao Miao published an article entitled [RNA 3D Structure Comparison Using RNA-Puzzles Toolkit] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36705910/) in the RNA Structure Prediction, RNA-Puzzles is a community-wide effort on the assessment of blind prediction of RNA tertiary structures. And RNA-Puzzles toolkit , a computational resource derived from RNA-Puzzles, is required to understand the achievements and bottlenecks of the prediction.</p>
