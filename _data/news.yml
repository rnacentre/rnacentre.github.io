  (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03150-z) in the Nature Medicine. \
  The study presents a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the human brain, covering nearly all major brain regions in health and disease, and demonstrates the utility of using the atlas to discover putative neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and understand microenvironment-driven differences in microglia. The brain cell atlas will become a valuable resource for studying brain cells and functions, and enhance our understanding of neuronal processes and neurodegenerative diseases."

  Thus, MST3-NS2A complex plays a major role in recruiting prM–E heterodimers and NS4A and mediates the virion assembly. Additionally, \
  we found that MST3 was biotinylated and combined with other proteins (e.g., ATG5, Sec24A, and SNX4) that are associated with the cellular membrane required for TBEV infection. Overall, \
  their study revealed a novel function for MST3 in TBEV infection and identified as a novel host factor supporting TBEV assembly"
