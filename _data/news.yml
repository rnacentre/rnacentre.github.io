  entitled [Single Cell Analysis of the Fate of Injected Oncogenic RasV12 Cells in Adult Wild Type Drosophila]\
  (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36996781/) in the Journal of innate immunity, \
  They have injected dish-cultured oncogenic RasV12 cells into adult male flies and analyzed by single cell transcriptomics their destiny within the host after 11 days.\
  They identified in the preinjection samples and in the 11-day postinjection samples in all 16 clusters of cells, of which 5 disappeared during the experiment in the host,\
  and they hypothesize that this results from a bitter dialogue between the injected cells and the host, while the experiments presented here should contribute to deciphering this dialogue"

  entitled [Structural basis of sRNA RsmZ regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence]\
  (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36828938/) in the Cell Research, \
  an intercellular communication network based on cell density, quorum sensing (QS), regulates numerous gene expressions including those related to both \
  acute and chronic virulence of P. aeruginosa. The global regulatory protein of the repressor of secondary metabolites (Rsm) system in bacteria, RsmA, \
  is found to predominantly regulate these virulence entities in P. aeruginosa by modulating related gene expressions at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels."

  headline: "Recently, Prof. Zhichao Miao and Prof.Xinwen Chen collaborated on an article\
  [Sterile 20-like kinase 3 promotes tick-borne encephalitis virus assembly by interacting with NS2A and prM and enhancing the NS2A-NS4A association]\
  (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36840407/) in the Journal of Medical virology, \
  they found that MST3 interacts with the viral proteins NS2A and prM; and MST3 enhances the interaction of NS2A–NS4A.\
  Thus, MST3-NS2A complex plays a major role in recruiting prM–E heterodimers and NS4A and mediates the virion assembly. Additionally, \
  we found that MST3 was biotinylated and combined with other proteins (e.g., ATG5, Sec24A, and SNX4) that are associated with the cellular membrane required for TBEV infection. Overall, \
  their study revealed a novel function for MST3 in TBEV infection and identified as a novel host factor supporting TBEV assembly"

  (https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2022.254) in the Zoological Research, \
  natural strabismus and amblyopia are accompanied by abnormal asymmetries of the visual system, especially visual neurophysiological and neurostructural defects. \
  Their results suggested that future therapeutic and mechanistic studies should consider defects and asymmetries throughout the entire visual system."

  entitled [Identification of visual cortex cell types and species differences \
  using single-cell RNA sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34590-1) \
  in the Nature Communications, they established a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 133,454 macaque visual cortical cells. \
It covers major cortical cell classes including 25 excitatory neuron types, 37 inhibitory neuron types and all glial cell types. \
The comparisons not only identified layer-specific markers, two crucial  neuron cell types, \
but also revealed that glutamatergic neurons may be more diverse across species than GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells. \
These findings pave the way for understanding how the primary cortex fulfills the high-cognitive functions."
